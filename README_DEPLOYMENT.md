## 🎯 Quick Deployment Guide

### Option 1: Use Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

```bash
# 1. Generate SECRET_KEY
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"

# 2. Push to GitHub
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy to Vercel"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main

# 3. Go to https://vercel.com/new
# 4. Import your repository
# 5. Add environment variables:
#    - SECRET_KEY = (your generated key)
#    - DEBUG = False
# 6. Click Deploy!
```

### Option 2: Use Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Deploy
vercel

# Add environment variables
vercel env add SECRET_KEY
vercel env add DEBUG

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod
```

## 💾 Database Information

**Current**: SQLite (ephemeral on Vercel)

**Your App**: ✅ Works perfectly! All content is hardcoded in views.

**Admin Panel**: ⚠️ Won't persist data between deployments

**Future Recommendation**: If you need persistent data later:
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - Free PostgreSQL
- [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) - Free MySQL
- [Neon](https://neon.tech/) - Free PostgreSQL
